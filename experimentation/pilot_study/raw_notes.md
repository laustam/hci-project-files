# Pilot Study - Raw Notes

## Participant 1

- Task 1: lots of clicking everywhere
- Flow 2 is better because can actually see difference between timer/stopwatch more explicit with toggle
- Odd to go to the same place for both
- Bookmarks unclear at first, comes with experience of app
- Toggle is kinda cool, would use hell yeah
- Visualizations are clear
- Icons are intuitive but why is there timer in calendar app
- Color is good

## Participant 2

- Task 1: accidentally started stopwatch, clicking on number to edit
- Flow 2 is better
- Doesn't like that you can't press the timer number to adjust timer duration
- Should be able to press anywhere on toggle to change - flaw with missing functionality of lo-fi
- Guessing what bookmarks are for: how much time each activity took? not clear if it's total time or time per sessions. is this from past events? where are dates
- Toggle does expansion is clear, purpose is not to scroll?
- Showing times in pm am, why? Should be user preference
- Separation of calendar and stats: yellow underline should be clearer, not very inviting. separation makes sense to not clutter
- Bookmarks icon is strange without intro or experience, could be same icon as play with different exponent icon, but might be confusing so there is tradeoff
- Colors are nice, maybe nav bar orange is strange, very harsh contrast


## Participant 3

- Task 2: clicking around first to different button, thought each is different feature
- Bookmarks are confusing could use description or call them presets
- App usage: could be useful cause there isn't a good application that combines everything yet, why not integrate everything seems useful
- Scrolling feature not implemented and increased time
- Researcher explained purpose of app badly, should explain timer feature better in intro
- Would want to use app to get better sense of how much time studying per week

## Participant 4
- Task 2: unsure where to find timer at first, tried to interact with other icons
- Can't cancel timer event, should be able to
- Statistics: where are the numbers or percentages? what is the order of the bar colors?
- Toggle is really cool, "wish this was available in more apps"
- Icons for Calendar and Stats pages make sense and don't need explanation
- Pointer to indicate current time in Calendar view should be added
