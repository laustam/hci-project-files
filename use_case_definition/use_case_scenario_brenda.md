# Use Case Scenario for Brenda

Brenda is curious about how she has allocated her time recently. She opens the app and taps the "chart icon" at the bottom right of the screen, which brings up a detailed pie chart. She is curious how she has spent her time this week so filters the data by "Week". The chart's dominant yellow slice immediately catches her eye, a visual cue that she has been dedicating a huge amount of time to work, at the expense of her personal and family life.

Determined to allocate her time more effectively, Brenda decides to use the app to schedule a 30 minute yoga session at 6PM. Brenda appreciates how the app not only allows her to block out this time but also adds it directly to the pie chart, offering her a visual representation of her commitment to self-care.

Brenda sees that she still has some time before her yoga session. She decides to spend it with her children. She sets a 1 hour timer for "Family Puzzle Time", ensuring that after the timer runs out, she will have enough time to get ready for yoga. This activity, too, is immediately reflected in her statistics, balancing the yellow with shades representing time spent with loved ones.
