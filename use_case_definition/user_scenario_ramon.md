# User Scenario for Ramon

We provide a concrete scenario for **Ramón**. Our application could help Ramón with his current predicament (see relevant situation). Ramón's boss, who has been using the application himself for quite some time, therefore recommends Ramón to use it. Our application is developed to gain a clear overview of daily activities through its time management and time tracking tools.

## A day in the life of Ramón
Ramón has been using the app for a few months now. His workday is nearly done but his boss suddenly rushes in, informing him that the focus of the project has shifted and resources need to be reallocated.

To reallocate these, Ramón needs a clear overview of the current allocation before making any adjustments. He used to find this hard to do; he would juggle between spreadsheets, emails, and issue tickets. However, now all this information can be found in one place. Not only that, the application instantly compiles all statistics regarding team projects for him. This way he can easily identify which teams are working on which parts and how many hours are allocated to each.

He notices that teams 1 and 2 are spending too many hours on the frontend and wants to reallocate them to the backend. The application allows him to change their schedule to account for this reallocation easily. With each update, the statistical overview immediately reflects these changes, helping him to see when to stop reallocating.

He continues working on the reallocation when suddenly his alarm goes off. The workday has ended but these changes need to be done urgently; he has to work overtime. Before continuing with his tasks, he starts the app's timer. By using this feature, the application handles tracking time spent in overtime for him, relieving him of manually tracking overtime hours and ensuring accurate compensation. He opens the app, presses the start timer button, and then continues working.

The hours tick by and he is about to be done, he only has one last thing to do: stop the timer. He does so and the timer prompts Ramón to enter a name and category to the current time tracked. Ramón calls it "Overtime" and puts it under the category "Work hours". The application conveniently adds this time spent into his schedule, and the statistical overview updates automatically.

It's getting late, Ramón drives home and quickly heads to bed. He notices that tomorrow morning he has fencing practice, which he has been looking forward to. He quickly views the app's statistical overview and finds that he has spent 10 hours on fencing this month. With tomorrow's practice, he will meet his goal of 12 hours! Finally, he happily heads to bed.
